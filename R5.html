<center>
<p> In rotation 5 of Digital Engineering we learned about the differences between additive and subtractive 3D printing, limits, and 
  materials used in the processes. For a project during this rotation we scanned ourselves and our friends and 3D printed models of 
  eachother. It was a great way to enjoy and learn about 3D printing. </p>
  
<p> Here is a picture of my bust as well as a 3D printed watering spike that was desgined by my friend John Barnes and I to fit directly
  to a water bottle. This was defiently our most challenging task so far. </p>
