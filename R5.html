<p> In rotation 5 of Digital Engineering we learned about the differences between additive and subtractive 3D printing, limits, and 
  materials used in the processes. For a project during this rotation we scanned ourselves and our friends and 3D printed models of 
  eachother. It was a great way to enjoy and learn about 3D printing. </p>
